Analyze the selection bias patterns from this coverage data:

TOP 5 TOPICS BY COVERAGE VARIANCE:
{{top_spread_table}}

OUTLET SPECIALIZATION:
{{outlet_specialization}}

SURPRISING COVERAGE GAPS:
{{surprising_gaps}}

Return 3-5 bullet points, each stating one clear finding about selection bias. Order them from most to least significant.

Each bullet must:
- Lead with the conclusion, not the data (e.g. "Daily FT systematically under-covers X..." not "X was covered at 4% by Daily FT...")
- Include specific outlet names and percentages
- Be one sentence

Cover: outlets with the most distinct editorial focus, the most surprising coverage gaps, and what the overall pattern reveals about editorial priorities.

    "## Approach\n",
    "1. Load pre-computed embeddings (same `google/embeddinggemma-300m` space across all outlets)\n",
    "2. Fit separate BERTopic models per outlet with adjusted parameters for smaller corpora\n",
    "3. Match topics across outlets using a 3-method ensemble (centroid similarity, keyword overlap, c-TF-IDF)\n",
    "4. Use the Hungarian algorithm for optimal 1-to-1 matching per outlet pair\n",
    "5. Group matched topics transitively via Union-Find\n",
    "6. Visualize coverage differences, keyword divergence, and selection bias signals"
